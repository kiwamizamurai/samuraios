## How to solve warning

Once I execute .bin file, I get the following
 
> WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'boot_sect_hello.bin' and probing guessed raw.
           Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
           Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.

To solve this problem, please use the following

    $ nasm -f bin boot_sect_hello.asm -o boot_sect_hello.bin
    $ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw boot_sect_hello.bin

Instead of 

    $ nasm -f bin boot_sect_hello.asm -o boot_sect_hello.bin
    $ qemu-system-x86_64 boot_sect_hello.bin

## what is  0x7c00 ?

Please open page 14 of [this document](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) and look at the figure with the memory layout.

As you can see, BIOS likes always to load the boot sector to the address **0x7c00**.
In the third attempt, we add the offset the secret to the address that we beleive BIOS to have loaded our code, **0x7c00**, using the CPU **add** instruction.
We can think of **add** as the higher level language statement **bx = bx + 0x7c00**. 
We have now calculated the correct memory address of our **’X’** and can store the contents of that address in **al**, ready for the BIOS print function, with the instruction mov al, **[bx]**.

## what is 0x2d ?

the_secret:
       ; ASCII code 0x58 ('X') is stored just before the zero-padding.
       ; On this code that is at byte 0x2d (check it out using 'xxd file.bin')
 
Firstly, you can confirm what is mentioned above with the following command:

    $ xxd -g 1 boot_sect_memory.bin
       
In this directory, it (the output) is stored as test.txt.

    $ cat test.txt

We can see that our **’X’**, which has an hexadecimal ASCII code **0x58**, is at an offset of **45 (0x2d) bytes** from the start of the code (**b4**), 
immediately before we padded the boot sector with zeros.
